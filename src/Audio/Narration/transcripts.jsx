    "Intro" : "^^^^In Toxic Rōnin, you play as Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese warrior who aspires to become the greatest swordsman alive. In a bout to gain prestige on his path to glory, Musashi kills two combatants of the distinguished Yoshioka School, singlehandedly disgracing their reputation. Now the warriors seek revenge against the wandering samurai who dared to dishonour them... ^^^^^^ The poison is spreading. I’m dripping with sweat, I feel lightheaded, there’s a stabbing in my stomach like I swallowed a pair of sai. I thought I could trust my hosts, but they were obviously loyal to the Yoshioka School. So much for the right of hospitality. We all ate from the same pot, so there must be an antidote. I need to get to their school... before it’s too late.",
    "forestIntro" : "^^^The entrance to the Yoshioka School is beyond the cave at the edge of these woods. Somehow I’ve got to get past their sentries. I did it once before, but with the state I’m in now I need to be more vigilant than ever. I can’t control the shaking of my limbs. Can’t even hold my katana still. This is going to be tough, but I’ve no choice if I want to see the sun rise tomorrow. Musashi stopped in his tracks. Though his usually acute senses were dulled somewhat, no poison could numb his instincts. Danger lay in the near vicinity to his left. The question was, did he have the strength to confront it, or should he take the risk of traversing the treacherous cliff on his right instead?"
