    "Intro" : "^^^^In Toxic Rōnin, you play as Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese warrior who aspires to become the greatest swordsman alive. In a bout to gain prestige on his path to glory, Musashi kills two combatants of the distinguished Yoshioka school, singlehandedly disgracing their reputation. Now the warriors seek revenge against the wandering samurai who dared to dishonour them... ^^^^^^ The poison is spreading.
